#torchlight-stuff

Torchlight mods and python scripts for convenience dealing with the utf-16
conversion.

The `bin` directory contains two python applications that I found useful while
working/on mods.

`datgrep` will search the directory tree starting with the current directory 
and match a term from the command line.

`datcat` will print a dat file to stdout.

The `mods` directory contains several mods I put together.

* Gemogrifier

Recipes to combine like gems into higher level gems.

* HyperGems

All gems have some +gold find and +experience.

* LazyStacks

Increase potion stack sizes.

* MessinWithMerchant

A scratchpad for adding items to the merchant.

* PolearmUpgrade

Make polearms better!!

* ReducedPunishment

Reduce the change of failure at the enchanter.

* YarrMeGold

Increase the amount of gold that drops.

### Installing mods on OSX

Just copy the mod to
`$HOME/Library/Application Support/runic games/torchlight/mods/`.
